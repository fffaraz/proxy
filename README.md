C++ TCP Proxy Server

## Description
The C++ TCP Proxy server is a simple and high performance utility using the ASIO networking library, for proxying (tunneling or redirecting) connections from external clients to a designated server. The TCP Proxy server can be used to easily and efficiently:
  * Limit the number of client connections to the server
  * Load balance client connections between multiple server instances
  * Provide IP or connection time based filtering and access control mechanisms
